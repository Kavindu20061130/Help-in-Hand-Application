# Help-in-Hand-Application
I developed a web application called Hand-in-Hand to support donations to charities and orphanages. The backend was built using Java, and the frontend used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose Java for its object-oriented structure, which improves code organization, maintainability, scalability, and overall backend performance.
